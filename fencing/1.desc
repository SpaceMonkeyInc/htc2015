path is presented counterclockwise

Can they:

1. parse XML
2. pick the right XML element (id=compund)
3. correctly parse a <path> element with absolute and relative motion,
   with spaces, without spaces, with integers, with reals
4. can they detect points on the perimeter as being inside the compound
   (usually the tests that see if a point is inside a polygon return
   indeterminant results if the point is exactly on the perimeter)
